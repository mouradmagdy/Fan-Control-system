# Fan-Control-system
This project implements an automatic fan control system using an AVR microcontroller. The system continuously monitors the temperature of the environment and adjusts the fan speed accordingly. It utilizes an LCD display to show the current temperature, providing real-time feedback to the user.

## Features
* Automatic fan speed control based on environmental temperature.
* Real-time temperature display on an LCD screen.
* Configurable temperature thresholds for fan speed adjustment.
* Efficient and reliable AVR microcontroller implementation.

## Components Used
* AVR Microcontroller (ATmega32)
* Temperature Sensor (LM35)
* LCD Display (16x2 character LCD)
* DC Fan
* Supporting components (e.g., resistors, capacitors, connectors)
